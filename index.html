                    Senya grew up in the Portland area, first attending the Portland French School before its unfortunate demise. Following departure at PFS he went to Three Rivers Charter School and then West Linn High School. Following a gap-year of skiing and some college courses at Marylhurst University and PSU, he went to Switzerland to study International Economics and Political Economy. Upon graduation, he started an indoor urban farm which now supplies produce to grocers, restaurants, and corporate campuses in the greater Portland area. To improve the environmental controls in the farm and make them more automated, he's now a student at Epicodus where he will learn the basics of programming in Ruby and Rails.</p>
                    <p class="text-success"> In his free time, Senya likes to hike, mountain bike, ski, and go rock climbing. These are all quite accessible in the surrounding area around Portland. If he doesn't get back to you immediately regarding your request for web development it's because he's out doing one of those things</p>

              Louis Pasteur was born in France in 1822. As a boy, he was interested in drawing and painting his surroundings in Arbois, the town where he grew up. While his teachers noted he had an eye for detail, his father did not see painting as a career and encouraged Pasteur to focus on his schoolwork instead.

              He began his career in chemistry at the University of Strasbourg, where he made a ground-breaking discovery that molecules produced by living things were left-handed. His discovery was a major contribution to microbiology and helped improve the understanding of DNA.

              Pasteur then moved on to studying fermentation and its causes. Since the time of Aristotle, people believed in spontaneous generation, where living organisms could grow from nonliving matter. It was commonly thought that insects such as fleas could arise from dust, or mice from bread. Louis Pasteur disproved this theory by demonstrating that micro-organisms could reproduce.

              His experiments showed how beverages, such as wine and milk, could be spoiled by the presence of bacteria. Spurred by the concept of beverage contamination, Pasteur then began his work on showing how germs led to disease in humans and animals.

              Pasteur’s “germ theory” wasn’t taken too well by the medical community and public, though. Béchamp, a rival of his, denounced his ideas as “the greatest scientific silliness of the age”, while La Presse, a French newspaper read: “I am afraid that the experiments you quote, M. Pasteur, will turn against you. The world into which you wish to take us is really too fantastic.”

              Louis Pasteur lived in a time when many people died from infectious diseases. Two of his own children had died from typhoid, which was caused by dirty food and water. Even though his theory on germs and disease was ridiculed then, today we know the importance of sanitation and the relationship between bacteria and sicknesses.

              The early stages of flight were a dangerous business. Lack of funding, lives lost, and scorn were just part of the process of aviation. The Wright Brothers, Wilbur and Orville, were not deterred.

              The brothers were born and raised in Dayton, Ohio in the late 1800s to a set of parents who encouraged them to learn new things. Their father often bought them toys that helped increase their knowledge of mechanics. Together, they ran a printing shop and bicycle shop, which later proved valuable in designing and building an airplane.

              They had their start in aviation when Wilbur was 32 and Orville was 28, as they began reading books on aeronautics and talking to engineers. In the process, they studied the work of other experimenters and birds in flights, which was where they came up with the concept of “wing warping.”

              Wing warping meant a pilot could control the plane by raising or lowering flips along the wings of a plane. They tested their idea initially with kites, then moved to gliders. The brothers chose Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, as their testing grounds due to its winds, hills, and sand.

              On December 17, 1903, they successfully flew the first free, controlled flight of a power-driven airplane for 59 seconds over 852 feet. Not all was smooth sailing (or flying), though. The press and fellow flight experts didn’t believe the claims they made. Scientific American Magazine referred to them as the “Lying Brothers.”

              Eventually, Wilbur decided to set off for Europe in hopes of a better reception. In France, he made public flights and gave rides to journalists and officials. Orville and their sister Katherine joined them, where they became immensely popular on the continent.

              They began to sell airplanes in Europe, then returned to the United States in 1909. The brothers became wealthy from their eventual success in Europe and the United States, and are known today as the “fathers of modern aviation.”

              Today, we know the Earth is round. There’s no doubt about it. If someone tried to say otherwise, we would all laugh.

              But that wasn’t always the case. It took a long time for this idea to become cemented as common knowledge.

              In ancient Egyptian, Mediterranean and Indian cultures, it was believed that the Earth was a flat disc surrounded by oceans. Nordic cultures believed the Earth was flat and surrounded by oceans as well, with a world tree (Yggdrasill) was in the center. Ancient China subscribed to the theory that the Earth was flat and square, while the heavens were round.

              Many pre-Socratic Greek philosophers believed the Earth was flat. Some, such as Anaximander, thought the Earth was a round cylinder with a flat top. Anaximenes believed the Earth was flat and rode on the air, similar to how the Sun, Moon, and other heavenly bodies were flat and rode the air.

              In sixth century BC, Greek philosopher Pythagoras claimed the Earth was round, although most philosophers remained skeptical. A few hundred years later, Aristotle studied the skies and remarked in his writings De caelo that stars were seen in Egypt and Cyprus, but not in the northerly regions. Based on this and his other observations of the stars and the Moon, he argued that the Earth was a sphere.

              By the fifth century, the idea of a spherical Earth became more accepted. There were still scholars that opposed this view, although they were in the minority.
