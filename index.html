                  Senya grew up in the Portland area, first attending the Portland French School before its unfortunate demise. Following departure at PFS he went to Three Rivers Charter School and then West Linn High School. Following a gap-year of skiing and some college courses at Marylhurst University and PSU, he went to Switzerland to study International Economics and Political Economy. Upon graduation, he started an indoor urban farm which now supplies produce to grocerers, restaurants, and corporate campuses in the greater Portland area. To improve the environmental controls in the farm and make them more automated, he's now a student at Epicodus where he will learn the basics of programming in Ruby and Rails.</p>
